I'm David, a Computer Science student at Lake Washington Institute of Technology with a strong interest in cybersecurity and secure system design. My exposure to CS actually started years ago at West Point, where programming and engineering fundamentals were part of the core curriculum. I wasn’t able to pursue the field at the time due to the demands of military service, but the interest never really went away. After leaving the Army, I finally had the chance to focus on CS and commit to it as a career.

I bring more than fifteen years of leadership experience as an Army officer, and that background shapes how I approach technical work. The military drilled into me the importance of integrity, clear communication, teamwork, and staying focused on the mission - values that carry over naturally into software development and cybersecurity. I’m also getting hands-on technical experience through my work with the IT department at LWIT, where I support users and troubleshoot systems. This role is giving me practical exposure to networks, access control, and operational security.

My professional interests include cybersecurity, software application development, full-stack web development, game design, and experimenting with AI tools and workflows. I enjoy projects that require both problem-solving and clear structure, and I’m steadily building the skills to contribute to real-world engineering environments.

Outside of academics, I stay busy with writing, gaming, travel, DIY coding projects, and finding ways to stay involved in the community. Long-term, I aim to build a career where I can combine my technical training with the discipline and leadership experience I developed in the Army.

### FullStack Node + PostgreSQL App  

A full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize ORM.  
Includes RESTful API endpoints, schemas, migrations, and HTML views for interacting with a live game-style database (Players, Enemies, Game Items).  
Features both local development and cloud deployment experience using AWS EC2 and PostgreSQL.  

Technologies Used: Node.js • Express.js • PostgreSQL • Sequelize ORM • HTML/CSS • JavaScript  
Role: Designed the database schema, built the full API, implemented all CRUD routes, created the HTML client pages, and deployed the system on AWS EC2 with a remote PostgreSQL instance.  

**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/doff87/FullStack_Node_Postgres_App  
A live demo is available at: http://3.139.71.91:5000/index.html    
(Hosted on AWS EC2 and accessible as long as the deployment remains active.)
